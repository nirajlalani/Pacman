# Pacman
This is an easier and smaller version of the original Pacman game built on Python. There is a .exe file to directly run the game on any desktop without having python or any IDE.

There are still some limitations to the features of the game like the movement of the character, or buttons for pausing or starting a new game.

-->The map is developed using just a list mapping.
-->There are two rules or functions file for the each vector to follow.
-->The speed of the ghosts and the main character can be changed as well.
